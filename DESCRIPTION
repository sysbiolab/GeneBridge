Description: GeneBridge provides tools for inferring the evolutionary roots of genes across multiple species. It implements the Bridge algorithm to identify the most likely rooting of genes within a given species tree. By rooting orthologous genes in large-scale evolutionary snalysis, GeneBridge can provide a framework for exploring evolutionary roots within biological systems.
